Microservice app

This is a backend   comprising of several components communicating to each other. 

The app  is a simple pipeline of a documents LLM that accept users documents files like images,pdf,doc,text,csv + users question or prompt to aggregate it .I planned to add user authentification and managment later.
Components
    
    All microservices are created using FastAPI 
 

Take a look at the components diagram that describes them and their interactions.
